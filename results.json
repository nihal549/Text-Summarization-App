  "Article": "\nThe two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu\u2019s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?\n\nThe blind King Dhritarashtra\u2019s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.\n\nThe words dharma k\u1e63hetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing.  Kurukshetra is described as kuruk\u1e63hetra\u1e41 deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means \u201cKurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.\u201d Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma. \n\nDhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them. He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.\n",
